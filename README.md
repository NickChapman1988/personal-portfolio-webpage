This mini project was made as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) Responsive Web Design certification course. 

The brief was to build a [CodePen.io](codepen.io) Personal Portfolio Webpage app that is functionally similar to this: https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/.

For this project, I utilised links to my Code Institute Milestone projects as portfolio examples. 

The freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum changed while I was making this project, preventing the submission of any JavaScript code, so this project uses basic HTML and CSS only (with a little bit of Bootstrap).

My original CodePen can be viewed [here](https://codepen.io/nickchapman1988/pen/gOvwROy)

As part of the project brief, several user stories were specified to be met. These were as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
    <th>STORY ID</th>
    <th>USER STORY</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #1:</td>
    <td>Your portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #2:</td>
    <td> The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #3:</td>
    <td>Your portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #4:</td>
    <td>The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #5:</td>
    <td>The projects section should contain at least one link to a project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    <td>The navbar should contain at least one link that you can click on to navigate to different sections of the page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
